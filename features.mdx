## Tagging and Searching Notes

You organize notes with flexible tagging and lightning-fast search. Tags act as dynamic filters, while full-text search handles fuzzy queries.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Tagging" icon="tag">
    Add tags like `#project-alpha` or `#idea` during capture.

    ```javascript
    // Example tag application via API
    await fetch('https://api.example.com/notes/123/tags', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ tags: ['#urgent', '#meeting'] })
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Searching" icon="search">
    Query with `tag:#project-alpha` or natural language.

    Use advanced operators like `from:2024-01` for date ranges.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You build habits with daily reviews that surface key notes. Export in multiple formats for backups or sharing.

<CodeGroup tabs="JSON,Markdown,CSV">

        "id": "note-456",
        "content": "Review daily goals",
